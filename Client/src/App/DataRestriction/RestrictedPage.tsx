/**
 * This component is used for rendering pages whose content (children)
 * is protected by a Data Restriction.
 * 
 * The UX is as follows:
 * 
 * (1) While the approvalStatus is loading, the page contents are rendered inside a
 *     "hidden" div
 * 
 * (2) Once the approvalStatus is done loading...
 * 
 * a. If the study does not exist (in the sense that it does not exist in the backend
 *    OR the study is marked as "disabled" by the WDK model), render our usual "not found" page
 *    instead of the page contents
 * 
 * b. If the user is approved to perform the action, display the page contents in an "unhidden" div
 * 
 * c. If the user is not approved to perform the action, display the page contents in a "blurred" div
 *    which stops the propagation of any user-interaction-related DOM events
